## Connecting to Databases

Once PostgreSQL is installed, you can connect to databases using command-line tools like `psql` or graphical user interface (GUI) clients.

## Creating Tables

Tables are the fundamental structure for storing data in a relational database. You can create tables using SQL commands, defining columns and constraints as needed.

## Querying Data

SQL provides powerful tools for querying data stored in PostgreSQL databases. This tutorial covers basic SELECT statements, filtering, sorting, and aggregation.

## Data Manipulation

Learn how to insert, update, and delete data in PostgreSQL tables using SQL commands. Topics include managing primary keys, constraints, and relationships between tables.
