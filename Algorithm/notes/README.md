# What is algorithm?

An algorithm consists of a series of sequential instructions designed to solve problems. Let's apply this concept to the process of making potato fries by following the steps outlined below.

1. **Ingredients:** Gather potatoes, oil, salt, and spices.
2. **Preparation:** Cut and soak potatoes.
3. **Frying:** Fry potatoes until golden.
4. **Seasoning:** Season fries.
5. **Serve:** Serve hot with optional toppings.

## Types of algorithms

1. **Searching:**
   - Linear search, binary search, hash table lookup
2. **Sorting:**
   - Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort
   - Time and space complexity analysis, trade-offs
3. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - Breaking down problems into subproblems, memoization to avoid redundant calculations (e.g., Fibonacci sequence)
4. **Greedy Algorithms:**
   - Making locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths)
5. **Backtracking:**
   - Systematically exploring all potential solutions using recursion (e.g., maze solving)
