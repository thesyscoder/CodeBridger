# BlogPulse

BlogPulse is a web application built using FastAPI, Pydantic, and SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL, designed to provide a dynamic and efficient platform for managing and analyzing blog data.

## Features

- **FastAPI**: Utilizes FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **Pydantic**: Pydantic provides data validation and settings management using Python type annotations, ensuring data consistency and correctness throughout the application.
- **SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL**: Integrates SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL database for efficient and scalable data storage and retrieval.
- **API Endpoints**: Define API endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage blog content and user interactions.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to sensitive endpoints and data.
- **Async Support**: Leverages asynchronous programming capabilities of FastAPI for improved performance and scalability.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- PostgreSQL
- Pipenv (optional, but recommended for managing dependencies)
