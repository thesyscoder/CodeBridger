## What is ES6?
ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6.

ECMAScript was created to standardize JavaScript, and ES6 is the 6th version of ECMAScript, it was published in 2015, and is also known as ECMAScript 2015.

### Classes
Classes are templates for creating objects in JavaScript, providing a blueprint for their structure and behavior.

### Arrow Functions
Arrow functions are a concise way to write functions in JavaScript, providing a shorter syntax compared to traditional function expressions.

### Variables (let, const, var)
Variables are containers for storing data values. `let` and `const` are block-scoped variables introduced in ES6, while `var` is function-scoped and pre-ES6.

### Array Methods like .map()
Array methods, such as `map()`, are built-in functions in JavaScript used to manipulate arrays. `map()` applies a function to each element of an array and returns a new array with the results.

### Destructuring
Destructuring is a feature in JavaScript that allows for unpacking values from arrays or objects into distinct variables.

### Modules
Modules are reusable pieces of code that encapsulate related functionality. They allow for better organization and maintainability of code by breaking it into smaller, independent units.

### Ternary Operator
The ternary operator (`? :`) is a concise way to write conditional expressions in JavaScript. It evaluates a condition and returns one of two values based on whether the condition is true or false.

### Spread Operator
The spread operator (`...`) is used to expand elements of an iterable (like arrays) or object properties into places where multiple elements/properties are expected.
