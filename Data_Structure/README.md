# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to the Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) folder! This folder is dedicated to practicing and mastering data structures and algorithms.

1. **Arrays:**
   - Implementation
   - Time/space complexity analysis
   - Dynamic resizing (if using a custom implementation)
2. **Linked Lists:**
   - Singly and doubly linked lists
   - Implementation (using objects to represent nodes)
   - Operations (insertion, deletion, searching, traversal) and complexities
3. **Stacks:**
   - LIFO principle
   - Implementation using arrays or linked lists
   - Operations (push, pop, peek, isEmpty) and complexities
   - Applications (function calls, undo/redo)
4. **Queues:**
   - FIFO principle
   - Implementation using arrays or linked lists (circular queue for efficiency)
   - Operations (enqueue, dequeue, peek, isEmpty) and complexities
   - Applications (breadth-first search, task scheduling)
5. **Trees:**
   - Binary trees, Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
   - Implementation (using objects with data and child pointers)
   - Traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order) and complexities
   - Operations (insertion, deletion, searching) and complexities
   - Applications (sorting, efficient searching)
6. **Hash Tables:**
   - Key-value pairs, hash function, collision resolution techniques
   - Implementation (using objects)
   - Operations (put, get, remove) and complexities
   - Applications (fast lookups by key, symbol tables)
7. **Graphs:**
   - Nodes (vertices) and edges, directed vs. undirected
   - Adjacency matrix or adjacency list representation
   - Traversal methods (depth-first search, breadth-first search) and complexities
   - Applications (modeling relationships, network analysis)
