# JavaScript Practice Problems

This repository contains practice problems to enhance your JavaScript skills. The problems are categorized from easy to hard, covering various JavaScript concepts.

## Array Problems

### Easy

2. **Remove Duplicates:** Remove duplicate elements from an array.
3. **Count Odd Numbers:** Count the number of odd numbers in an array.
4. **Merge Arrays:** Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.
5. **Find Maximum:** Find the maximum element in an array.
6. **Find Minimum:** Find the minimum element in an array.

## Objects Problems

### Easy

1. **Object Creation:** Create an object representing a car with properties like make, model, and year. Print out the details of the car.

2. **Object Modification:** Modify the car object from the previous task to include a new property color. Update the color of the car and print the updated details.

3. **Accessing Object Properties:** Create an object representing a person with properties name, age, and gender. Print out each property of the person object.

4. **Adding Methods to Objects:** Extend the person object from the previous task with a method introduce that prints a greeting including the person's name.

5. **Object Iteration:** Create an object representing a shopping list with items and quantities. Write a function to loop through the shopping list and print each item with its quantity.

### Medium

1. **Object Comparison:** Create two objects representing different students with properties like name, age, and grade. Write a function to compare the ages of the students and print the older student's name.

2. **Prototype Inheritance:** Define a parent object Vehicle with properties make and model. Create a child object Car that inherits from Vehicle and adds a property numDoors. Print the details of a car object.

3. **Object Composition:** Define two objects representing a rectangle and a circle with properties like width, height, and radius. Write a function to calculate the total area when both shapes are combined.

4. **Object Destructuring:** Create an object representing a user with properties name and email. Use object destructuring to extract the user's name and email into separate variables.

5. **Object Cloning:** Create an object representing a book with properties like title, author, and genre. Write a function to clone the book object into a new object and modify one of its properties.

### Hard

1. **Object Serialization:** Define an object representing a product with properties like name, price, and category. Serialize the object into JSON format and then parse it back into an object.

2. **Object Immutability:** Create an object representing a configuration with properties like theme, language, and fontSize. Write a function to return a new object with an updated theme, keeping the original configuration intact.

3. **Object Composition with ES6 Classes:** Define a class Animal with properties name and type. Create a class Dog that extends Animal and adds a property breed. Instantiate a dog object and print its details.

4. **Object Manipulation with Object.assign():** Create two objects representing users with properties like name and email. Use Object.assign() to merge the properties of both users into a new object.

5. **Object Extension with Spread Operator:** Define an object representing a product with properties like name, price, and description. Create a new product object with the same properties but with an additional property discount.

## ES6+ Features Problems

### Easy

1. **Arrow Functions:** Convert a traditional function to an arrow function.
2. **Template Literals:** Use template literals to concatenate strings and variables.
3. **Destructuring Assignment:** Destructure an object or array to extract specific values.

### Medium

4. **Spread Operator:** Use the spread operator to merge arrays or objects.
5. **Default Parameters:** Implement default parameters in a function.
6. **Rest Parameters:** Use rest parameters to handle an arbitrary number of arguments in a function.

### Hard

2. **Throw Error:** Throw a custom error with a specific message.

### Medium

3. **Error Types:** Handle different types of errors (e.g., SyntaxError, ReferenceError) gracefully.

### Hard

4. **Promise Error Handling:** Handle errors in asynchronous code using Promises.
