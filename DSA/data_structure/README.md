# Data Structure

Data structures are fundamental concepts in computer science and are used to organize and manipulate data efficiently. They provide a way to store, access, and manipulate data in various forms, depending on the specific requirements of an algorithm or a problem.

## Data Structure

- Array : A collection of elements that are stored at contiguous memory locations.

- Stacks : It is a linear data structure which follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.

- Queues: It is also known as First In First Out (FIFO) data structure. The operations performed on
  queues are enqueue and dequeue.

- Linked Lists: Unlike arrays, linked lists use non-contiguous memory allocation for storing
  elements. Each element in a list consists of two parts called ‘head’ and ‘tail'. 'Head' contains  
  the data field and a reference(link) to the next node whereas ‘Tail’ contains only a link to  
  the next node.

- Trees: It is a hierarchical data structure where each node has a root value and one or more child nodes.

- Graphs: A graph is an aggregate of nodes connected by edges. There can be directed graphs and undirected graphs.
