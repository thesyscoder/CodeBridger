## Comprehensive JavaScript Roadmap with JavaScript, Math, DSA and Frameworks

This roadmap combines essential data structures, algorithms, and foundational math concepts with practical JavaScript implementation. It also introduces popular web frameworks like Express.js, React, and Redux for a well-rounded understanding.

**Phase 1: Foundational Math and JavaScript**

- **Math:**
  - **Basic Arithmetic:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus (%)
  - **Algebra:** Linear equations, inequalities
  - **Discrete Math:** Sets, relations, functions
  - **Number Theory:** Prime numbers, modular arithmetic
  - **Probability and Statistics:** Probability distributions, random number generation
- **JavaScript:**
  - **Variables:** Data types, declaration, scope
  - **Operators:** Arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise
  - **Control Flow:** Conditional statements (if/else), loops (for, while, do-while)
  - **Functions:** Defining, calling, arguments, recursion
  - **Arrays:** Basic operations, built-in methods (map, filter, reduce)
  - **Objects:** Key-value pairs, accessing properties, methods
  - **classes** serve as blueprints for creating
  - **objects**. Objects encapsulate both data (properties) and behavior (methods).
  - **Encapsulation** refers to the concept of hiding the internal state of an object and restricting access to it from outside the class. This promotes data integrity by preventing unintended manipulation of data. In languages like Java, this is often achieved through access modifiers like private, protected, and public.
  - **Inheritance** is a mechanism where a new class can inherit properties and methods from an existing class. This promotes code reusability and allows for the creation of hierarchies of classes. Inheritance enables a subclass to inherit behaviors and characteristics of its superclass while also allowing for customization and extension.
  - **Polymorphism** is the ability of objects of different classes to respond differently to the same method call. This can be achieved through method overriding or dynamic method binding in some languages. Polymorphism allows for code flexibility and adaptability, as objects can exhibit different behaviors based on their specific implementations of methods.

**Phase 2: Data Structures**

1. **Arrays:**
   - Implementation
   - Time/space complexity analysis
   - Dynamic resizing (if using a custom implementation)
2. **Linked Lists:**
   - Singly and doubly linked lists
   - Implementation (using objects to represent nodes)
   - Operations (insertion, deletion, searching, traversal) and complexities
3. **Stacks:**
   - LIFO principle
   - Implementation using arrays or linked lists
   - Operations (push, pop, peek, isEmpty) and complexities
   - Applications (function calls, undo/redo)
4. **Queues:**
   - FIFO principle
   - Implementation using arrays or linked lists (circular queue for efficiency)
   - Operations (enqueue, dequeue, peek, isEmpty) and complexities
   - Applications (breadth-first search, task scheduling)
5. **Trees:**
   - Binary trees, Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
   - Implementation (using objects with data and child pointers)
   - Traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order) and complexities
   - Operations (insertion, deletion, searching) and complexities
   - Applications (sorting, efficient searching)
6. **Hash Tables:**
   - Key-value pairs, hash function, collision resolution techniques
   - Implementation (using objects)
   - Operations (put, get, remove) and complexities
   - Applications (fast lookups by key, symbol tables)
7. **Graphs:**
   - Nodes (vertices) and edges, directed vs. undirected
   - Adjacency matrix or adjacency list representation
   - Traversal methods (depth-first search, breadth-first search) and complexities
   - Applications (modeling relationships, network analysis)

**Phase 3: Algorithms**

1. **Searching:**
   - Linear search, binary search, hash table lookup
2. **Sorting:**
   - Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort
   - Time and space complexity analysis, trade-offs
3. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - Breaking down problems into subproblems, memoization to avoid redundant calculations (e.g., Fibonacci sequence)
4. **Greedy Algorithms:**
   - Making locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths)
5. **Backtracking:**
   - Systematically exploring all potential solutions using recursion (e.g., maze solving)
**Phase 4: Advanced Web Development with FastAPI (Python) and Full Stack Development**

1. **FastAPI:**
   - Introduction to asynchronous web frameworks in Python
   - Building high-performance APIs with FastAPI

   - Implementing OAuth2 authentication with FastAPI

3. **SQLAlchemy:**
   - Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) with SQLAlchemy for database interaction
   - Models, relationships, queries
   - Integration with FastAPI for database-driven web applications
